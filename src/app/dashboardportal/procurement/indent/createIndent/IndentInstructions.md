# Indent Page — Procurement Module

## 1. Overview

The **Indent** page is part of the Procurement module. It allows users to create indents (material/service requests) based on a combination of **Indent Type** and **Expense Type**. The system enforces validation rules at both the header and line-item levels depending on this combination.

This document serves as:

- **AI Agent Context** — a reference for automated decision-making and validation logic.
- **Developer Technical Spec** — a definitive source for implementing business rules.
- **End-User Documentation** — a guide for understanding how indent creation works.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Indent Types

| Indent Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Regular** | A standard indent raised for routine procurement needs. |
| **Open**    | An open-ended indent, typically used for recurring or flexible requirements. |
| **BOM**     | A Bill of Materials indent, used for structured material lists that can be saved and reused. |

### 2.2 Expense Types

| Expense Type    | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **General**     | General-purpose expenses not tied to a specific category. |
| **Maintenance** | Expenses related to maintenance activities. |
| **Production**  | Expenses related to production processes. |
| **Overhaul**    | Expenses related to overhaul or refurbishment activities. |
| **Capital**     | Capital expenditure items. |

---

## 3. Header Rules

When a user creates an indent, the system applies **header-level rules** based on the selected Indent Type and Expense Type combination.

### 3.1 Regular Indent Type

| Expense Type  | Indent Name Field | Line Item Logic |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| General       | Hidden (auto/system-assigned) | 1 |
| Maintenance   | Hidden | 1 |
| Production    | Hidden | 1 |
| Overhaul      | Hidden | 1 |
| Capital       | Hidden | 2 |

### 3.2 Open Indent Type

| Expense Type  | Indent Name Field | Line Item Logic |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| General       | Hidden | 3 |
| Maintenance   | Hidden | 3 |
| Production    | Hidden | 3 |

### 3.3 BOM Indent Type

| Expense Type  | Indent Name Field | Line Item Logic |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| General       | BOM selection (see below) | 1 |
| Maintenance   | BOM selection (see below) | 1 |
| Production    | BOM selection (see below) | 1 |
| Capital       | BOM selection (see below) | 2 |
| Overhaul      | BOM selection (see below) | 2 |

**BOM Selection Behavior:**
When the Indent Type is **BOM**, the system prompts the user with two options:

1. **Create a new BOM** — The Indent Name field becomes a text entry field where the user types a name for the new BOM.
2. **Use an existing BOM** — The system presents a reference list of previously saved BOMs (from past indents saved as reusable templates) for the user to select from.

## 4. Indent View Fields

The indent listing view displays the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status (Header)** | Current status of the indent at the header level. |
| **Indent Type** | Regular, Open, or BOM. |
| **Expense Type** | General, Maintenance, Production, Overhaul, or Capital. |
| **Indent Line Item ID** | Unique identifier for each line item within the indent. |
| **Current Indent Outstanding** | Outstanding quantity for the indent (can be 0), tracked against the detail ID. |
| **Balance Outstanding against Item ID** | Remaining balance outstanding for the item. **Available only for Maintenance, Production, and General expense types.** |

## 5. Line Item Validation Logic

Each line item added to an indent is validated according to one of three logic sets, determined by the Indent Type + Expense Type combination (see Section 3).

---

### 5.1 Logic 1 — Max/Min Quantity Validation with Stock Check

**Applies to:** Regular (General, Maintenance, Production, Overhaul) and BOM (General, Maintenance, Production).

This is the most rigorous validation. It checks existing indents, stock levels, and calculates allowable indent quantities.

#### Step-by-step:

**Step 1 — Check for open indent against the item**
When the user selects an item, the system checks if an open indent already exists for that item. If it does, an **error message is displayed** on item selection. This check must be performed at the point of item selection (i.e., the open indent status must be available alongside the item list).

**Step 2 — Check stock + outstanding against max quantity**
The system evaluates: `branch_stock + outstanding_indent_qty > max_qty`

- If **no max quantity exists** for the item, the user may enter any value. Skip Step 3.
- If the above condition is **true**, display an error message and prevent entry.
- If the condition is **false**, proceed to Step 3.

**Step 3 — Calculate allowable indent quantity (max and min)**
Apply the following formula to determine the maximum indent quantity the user can request:

```
max_indent_qty = IF(
    (max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty) < reorder_qty,
    reorder_qty,
    ROUNDUP((max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty) / reorder_qty, 0) * reorder_qty
)
```

The **minimum indent quantity** is taken from the item master's `min_qty` value.

The user may enter any quantity between `min_qty` and `max_indent_qty`.

#### Formula Explanation

The formula ensures:

- If the available-to-indent quantity (`max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty`) falls below the reorder quantity, the system allows at least one reorder quantity.
- Otherwise, the quantity is rounded up to the nearest multiple of the reorder quantity.

#### Worked Example

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| max_qty (from item master) | 100 |
| min_qty (from item master) | 20 |
| reorder_qty | 10 |
| branch_stock | 60 |
| outstanding_indent_qty | 10 |

**Calculation:**

```
available = max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty
         = 100 - 60 - 10
         = 30

Is 30 < reorder_qty (10)?  → No

max_indent_qty = ROUNDUP(30 / 10, 0) * 10
               = ROUNDUP(3, 0) * 10
               = 3 * 10
               = 30
```

**Result:** User can enter a quantity between **20** (min_qty) and **30** (max_indent_qty).

### 5.2 Logic 2 —  Open Entry Validation with Financial Year Check

**Applies to:**  Open (General, Maintenance, Production).

This logic includes financial-year-scoped checks and enforces max quantity as the value.

#### Step-by-step:

**Step 1 — Check for existing open indent (financial year scoped)**
The system checks if an open indent already exists for the item **within the current financial year**. If one exists in status_id other than 4,5,6. for this it needs to map the header from the item_id for the indent_id and then retreive it. display an error message and clear the field. 

**Step 2 — Check if max/min exists**
If no max/min quantity is defined for the item, display an error message and clear the field. The user cannot proceed without max/min values.

**Step 3 — Check for outstanding indent quantity from Regular/BOM indents**
The system checks if there is any outstanding indent quantity from Regular or BOM indents for the same item. If there is, display an **informational message** (warning), but **allow the user to continue**.

**Step 4 — Set quantity**
The **max quantity** from the item master is taken as the indent quantity value. The user cannot edit this value.

---

### 5.3 Logic 3 — (No Validation) Capital/Overhaul 

**Applies to:** Regular (Capital, Overhaul) and BOM (Capital, Overhaul).

No quantity validation is applied. The user can enter any value for the indent quantity. no other verification either needs to be done.

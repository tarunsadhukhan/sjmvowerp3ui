# Purchase Order (PO) Page — Procurement Module

## 1. Overview

The **Purchase Order (PO)** page is part of the Procurement module. It allows users to create purchase orders either **directly** (without an indent) or **against existing indents**. The system behaviour depends on a **company-level configuration** that determines whether indent usage is mandatory or optional.

This document serves as:

- **AI Agent Context** — a reference for automated decision-making and validation logic.
- **Developer Technical Spec** — a definitive source for implementing business rules.
- **End-User Documentation** — a guide for understanding how PO creation works.

**Prerequisite reading:** The Indent Page specification. PO validation logic references and builds upon indent concepts (expense types, max/min/reorder quantities, stock checks, financial year scoping).

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 PO Creation Modes

The system supports two PO creation modes, governed by a **company configuration flag** stored in a separate configuration table.

| Config Setting | Behaviour |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Indent Mandatory = ON** | All POs must be created against approved indents. Direct PO creation is disabled. |
| **Indent Mandatory = OFF** | Users may create POs directly (without indent) or against indents. Both paths are available. |

### 2.2 PO Types

| PO Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Regular** | A standard purchase order for one-time or routine procurement. |
| **Open** | An open-ended purchase order, typically used for recurring or flexible requirements within a financial year. |

When a PO is created **against an indent**, the PO Type is **inherited from the Indent Type** using the following mapping:

| Indent Type | Inherited PO Type |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Regular | Regular |
| BOM | Regular |
| Open | Open |

When a PO is created **directly** (no indent), the user selects the PO Type manually.

### 2.3 Expense Types

Expense types are identical to those in the Indent module:

| Expense Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **General** | General-purpose expenses not tied to a specific category. |
| **Maintenance** | Expenses related to maintenance activities. |
| **Production** | Expenses related to production processes. |
| **Overhaul** | Expenses related to overhaul or refurbishment activities. |
| **Capital** | Capital expenditure items. |

When a PO is created against an indent, the Expense Type is **inherited from the indent header**. When created directly, the user selects it manually.

---

## 3. Header Rules

### 3.1 Indent-Based PO

When creating a PO against indents, the header fields are determined as follows:

| Field | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| **PO Type** | Auto-inherited from indent type (see Section 2.2 mapping). Read-only. |
| **Expense Type** | Auto-inherited from indent header. Read-only. |
| **Party (Supplier)** | User selects from Party Master (filtered to party_type = 'supplier'). |
| **Rate** | Manual entry per line item. |

**Indent selection:** The user is presented with a list of approved indents that have outstanding (unfulfilled) quantities. Multiple indents can be selected and clubbed into a single PO (see Section 5 for FIFO consumption logic).

### 3.2 Direct PO (No Indent)

When creating a PO directly (only available when Indent Mandatory = OFF):

| Field | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| **PO Type** | User selects: Regular or Open. |
| **Expense Type** | User selects: General, Maintenance, Production, Overhaul, or Capital. |
| **Party (Supplier)** | User selects from Party Master (filtered to party_type = 'supplier'). |
| **Rate** | Manual entry per line item. |

The selected PO Type + Expense Type combination determines which **line item validation logic** applies (see Section 6).

---

## 4. PO View Fields

The PO listing view displays the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **PO Status (Header)** | Current status of the PO at the header level. |
| **PO Type** | Regular or Open. |
| **Expense Type** | General, Maintenance, Production, Overhaul, or Capital. |
| **PO Line Item ID** | Unique identifier for each line item within the PO. |
| **Party Name** | Supplier name from the Party Master. |
| **Rate** | Unit rate for the line item. |
| **Quantity** | Ordered quantity for the line item. |
| **Source** | Indicates whether the line item is indent-based or direct. |
| **Linked Indent Line Item ID(s)** | Reference to source indent line item(s), if applicable. Displays "Direct" for non-indent POs. |

---

## 5. Indent-Based PO — Line Item Logic

When a PO is created against indents, the system **trusts the indent-stage validation**. No re-validation of stock levels or max/min quantities is performed at PO creation time. The primary control is ensuring PO quantities do not exceed indent outstanding quantities (subject to tolerance).

### 5.1 Quantity Control — Tolerance

Each item in the Item Master carries a **tolerance percentage** field. The maximum PO quantity against an indent line item is calculated as:

```
max_po_qty = indent_outstanding_qty × (1 + tolerance_pct / 100)
```

If no tolerance is defined for the item, the PO quantity must **exactly match or be less than** the indent outstanding quantity (i.e., tolerance = 0%).

### 5.2 FIFO Consumption Logic (Multi-Indent Clubbing)

When a single PO line item draws from **multiple indent line items for the same item**, the system applies **FIFO (First In, First Out)** consumption based on indent creation date/sequence.

#### Behaviour

- **Frontend:** Displays a single consolidated line item showing the **total quantity** and item details. The user enters one quantity value.
- **Backend:** Stores **multiple records** — one per indent line item consumed — each recording the quantity consumed from that specific indent.
- **API Response:** Returns the data as a **single aggregated entry** per item, with the consumed indent breakdown available in a nested/detail structure if needed.

#### Worked Example

| Indent | Indent Line Item | Item | Outstanding Qty | Created Date |
|--------|-----------------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| IND-001 | IND-001-LI-01 | Item A | 5 | 01-Apr-2025 |
| IND-002 | IND-002-LI-03 | Item A | 6 | 15-Apr-2025 |

**User enters PO quantity for Item A: 8**

FIFO consumption:

| Step | Source Indent Line Item | Consumed | Remaining in Indent |
|------|------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | IND-001-LI-01 (oldest) | 5 (fully consumed) | 0 |
| 2 | IND-002-LI-03 | 3 (partially consumed) | 3 |

**Database records created:**

| PO Line Item ID | Item | Qty | Linked Indent Line Item | Consumed from Indent |
|----------------|------|-----|-------------------------|---------------------|
| PO-001-LI-01a | Item A | 5 | IND-001-LI-01 | 5 of 5 |
| PO-001-LI-01b | Item A | 3 | IND-002-LI-03 | 3 of 6 |

**Frontend display:**

| PO Line Item | Item | Qty | Rate |
|-------------|------|-----|------|
| PO-001-LI-01 | Item A | 8 | ₹XX.XX |

#### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| PO qty exceeds total available across all indents (after tolerance) | Error: quantity exceeds available indent outstanding. |
| Only one indent exists for the item | Single record in DB, standard display. No FIFO needed. |
| User reduces qty after initial entry | Re-apply FIFO from the beginning with the new qty. |
| Indent line item has 0 outstanding | Skip it in FIFO; move to next. |

### 5.3 Open PO from Open Indent

When the source indent is of type **Open**, the PO inherits the Open PO type. The behaviour at PO stage mirrors the indent:

- The **max quantity from the item master** is carried forward as the PO quantity (user cannot edit quantity).
- The **rate** is entered manually by the user (this is the only additional field vs the indent).
- Financial year scoping from the indent carries through.

---

## 6. Direct PO — Line Item Validation Logic

When creating a PO **directly** (no indent), the system must apply the same validation rules that would have been enforced at indent stage, since no prior validation has occurred.

The validation logic is determined by the **PO Type + Expense Type** combination, mirroring the indent validation matrix.

---

### 6.1 Logic 1 — Max/Min Quantity Validation with Stock Check

**Applies to:** Regular PO with General, Maintenance, Production, or Overhaul expense types.

This is identical to Indent Logic 1. The system performs all checks at PO creation time.

#### Step-by-step:

**Step 1 — Check for open indent against the item**
When the user selects an item, the system checks if an open indent already exists for that item. If it does, an **error message is displayed** on item selection. This prevents duplicate procurement.

**Step 2 — Check for existing PO against the item**
Additionally, the system checks if an open/active PO already exists for the same item. If it does, display an **error message** and prevent selection.

**Step 3 — Check stock + outstanding against max quantity**
The system evaluates: `branch_stock + outstanding_indent_qty + outstanding_po_qty > max_qty`

- If **no max quantity exists** for the item, the user may enter any value. Skip Step 4.
- If the above condition is **true**, display an error message and prevent entry.
- If the condition is **false**, proceed to Step 4.

> **Note:** For direct POs, `outstanding_po_qty` must also be factored into the stock check since there is no indent acting as a prior control.

**Step 4 — Calculate allowable PO quantity (max and min)**
Apply the following formula to determine the maximum PO quantity the user can request:

```
max_po_qty = IF(
    (max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty - outstanding_po_qty) < reorder_qty,
    reorder_qty,
    ROUNDUP((max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty - outstanding_po_qty) / reorder_qty, 0) * reorder_qty
)
```

The **minimum PO quantity** is taken from the item master's `min_qty` value.

The user may enter any quantity between `min_qty` and `max_po_qty`.

#### Formula Explanation

The formula is identical to the indent formula but includes `outstanding_po_qty` in the deduction to account for quantities already committed via other direct POs.

#### Worked Example

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| max_qty (from item master) | 100 |
| min_qty (from item master) | 20 |
| reorder_qty | 10 |
| branch_stock | 50 |
| outstanding_indent_qty | 10 |
| outstanding_po_qty | 5 |

**Calculation:**

```
available = max_qty - branch_stock - outstanding_indent_qty - outstanding_po_qty
         = 100 - 50 - 10 - 5
         = 35

Is 35 < reorder_qty (10)?  → No

max_po_qty = ROUNDUP(35 / 10, 0) * 10
           = ROUNDUP(3.5, 0) * 10
           = 4 * 10
           = 40
```

**Result:** User can enter a quantity between **20** (min_qty) and **40** (max_po_qty).

---

### 6.2 Logic 2 — Open Entry Validation with Financial Year Check

**Applies to:** Open PO with General, Maintenance, or Production expense types.

This is identical to Indent Logic 2, applied at PO stage.

#### Step-by-step:

**Step 1 — Check for existing open PO (financial year scoped)**
The system checks if an open PO already exists for the item **within the current financial year**. If one exists with an active status (i.e., not in cancelled/closed/rejected states), display an error message and clear the field.

**Step 2 — Check for existing open indent (financial year scoped)**
Additionally, check if an open indent exists for the item in the current FY. If one exists, display an **informational message** (warning) — the user may continue but should be aware procurement is already in progress via the indent route.

**Step 3 — Check if max/min exists**
If no max/min quantity is defined for the item, display an error message and clear the field. The user cannot proceed without max/min values.

**Step 4 — Check for outstanding indent quantity from Regular/BOM indents**
The system checks if there is any outstanding indent quantity from Regular or BOM indents for the same item. If there is, display an **informational message** (warning), but **allow the user to continue**.

**Step 5 — Set quantity and rate**
The **max quantity** from the item master is taken as the PO quantity value. The user **cannot edit the quantity**. The user enters the **rate** manually.

---

### 6.3 Logic 3 — No Validation (Capital/Overhaul)

**Applies to:** Regular PO with Capital expense type. Also applies when PO Type is Regular or Open and Expense Type is Capital or Overhaul — **but only when no max/min quantity is available for that item**.

No quantity validation is applied. The user can enter any value for the PO quantity. No other verification is required.

**Explicit triggers for Logic 3:**
1. PO Type = Regular, Expense Type = Capital → Always Logic 3.
2. PO Type = Regular, Expense Type = Overhaul → Logic 1 applies (has stock check), BUT if no max_qty exists for the item, the user may enter any value (Logic 1 Step 2 skip path).
3. Any combination where the item has no max/min qty defined and expense type is Capital or Overhaul → Free entry.

## 7. Summary Matrix — Direct PO Validation

| PO Type | Expense Type | Line Item Logic | Key Behaviour |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Regular | General | 1 | Stock check + max/min formula (includes outstanding PO qty) |
| Regular | Maintenance | 1 | Stock check + max/min formula (includes outstanding PO qty) |
| Regular | Production | 1 | Stock check + max/min formula (includes outstanding PO qty) |
| Regular | Overhaul | 1 | Stock check + max/min formula (includes outstanding PO qty) |
| Regular | Capital | 3 | Free entry, no validation |
| Open | General | 2 | FY check + max qty as value + rate entry |
| Open | Maintenance | 2 | FY check + max qty as value + rate entry |
| Open | Production | 2 | FY check + max qty as value + rate entry |

> **Note:** Open PO with Capital or Overhaul expense types is **not a valid combination**. The system should not allow this selection. This mirrors the indent module where Open indent type only supports General, Maintenance, and Production.

---

## 8. Summary Matrix — Indent-Based PO Validation

| Source Indent Type | Source Expense Type | Inherited PO Type | Line Item Logic | Key Behaviour |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Regular | General | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| Regular | Maintenance | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| Regular | Production | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| Regular | Overhaul | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| Regular | Capital | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| Open | General | Open | Trust indent | Max qty carried forward + rate entry |
| Open | Maintenance | Open | Trust indent | Max qty carried forward + rate entry |
| Open | Production | Open | Trust indent | Max qty carried forward + rate entry |
| BOM | General | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| BOM | Maintenance | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| BOM | Production | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| BOM | Capital | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |
| BOM | Overhaul | Regular | Trust indent | Qty ≤ indent outstanding (+ tolerance) |

## 10. Error & Message Reference

### 10.1 Indent-Based PO

| Trigger | Message Type | User Action |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| PO qty exceeds indent outstanding (+ tolerance) for a single indent line item | Error | Reduce quantity to within allowed range. |
| PO qty exceeds total indent outstanding across all clubbed indents (+ tolerance) | Error | Reduce quantity or add more indents. |
| Selected indent has no outstanding quantity | Warning | Indent is fully consumed; select a different indent. |
| Tolerance not defined for item | Info | System uses 0% tolerance (exact match). |

### 10.2 Direct PO — Logic 1

| Trigger | Message Type | User Action |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Open indent exists for selected item | Error | Item cannot be selected; user must use indent-based PO route. |
| Open/active PO exists for selected item | Error | Item cannot be selected; user must resolve existing PO. |
| Branch stock + outstanding indent + outstanding PO > max qty | Error | Entry blocked; user cannot proceed. |
| No max qty defined for item | None | User may enter any value; skip formula. |

### 10.3 Direct PO — Logic 2

| Trigger | Message Type | User Action |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Open PO exists in current FY for the item | Error | Field cleared; user cannot proceed. |
| Open indent exists in current FY for the item | Warning | Informational only; user may continue. |
| No max/min defined for item | Error | Field cleared; user cannot proceed. |
| Outstanding Regular/BOM indent qty exists for the item | Warning | Informational only; user may continue. |

### 10.4 Direct PO — Logic 3

No error messages. Free entry is allowed.

## 11. Configuration Dependencies

| Config Key | Location | Impact |
|------------|----------|--------|
| `indent_mandatory` | Company Config Table | Determines whether direct PO creation is available. When ON, only indent-based POs are allowed. |
| `tolerance_pct` | Item Master | Per-item tolerance percentage for PO qty vs indent outstanding qty. Default: 0%. |
| `max_qty` | Item Master | Maximum stock quantity. Used in validation Logics 1 and 2. |
| `min_qty` | Item Master | Minimum order quantity. Used in validation Logic 1. |
| `reorder_qty` | Item Master | Standard reorder quantity. Used as rounding unit in Logic 1 formula. |

## 12. Decision Flowchart — PO Creation Path

```
START: User initiates PO creation
│
├─ Is indent_mandatory = ON?
│   ├─ YES → Only indent-based PO path available
│   │         → User selects indent(s) with outstanding qty
│   │         → PO Type & Expense Type inherited
│   │         → Apply tolerance check per line item
│   │         → Apply FIFO if multiple indents for same item
│   │         → User enters rate
│   │         → DONE
│   │
│   └─ NO → User chooses: Indent-based OR Direct?
│       │
│       ├─ INDENT-BASED → (same as above)
│       │
│       └─ DIRECT →
│           → User selects PO Type (Regular / Open)
│           → User selects Expense Type
│           → Determine validation logic from matrix (Section 7)
│           │
│           ├─ Logic 1 → Stock check + max/min formula
│           ├─ Logic 2 → FY check + max qty as value + rate
│           └─ Logic 3 → Free entry + rate
│
END
